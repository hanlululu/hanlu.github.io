# About me 

I am a PhD student at the Social Interaction and Neuroscience Lab (SINeLab) at Technical University of Denmark.

I study how people coordinate their behavior and synchronise physiological signals during social interactions — both in controlled lab experiments and real-world settings.

## In the lab, 

I examine **interpersonal coordination dynamics in conversation**: 

*   how **asymmetric noise** (where one person experiences reduced hearing abilities while the other does not) impacts communication patterns 
*   how **leader-follower dynamics** unfold,
*   how people adjust **movements to each other**, 
*   what strategies they use to maintain effective dialogue.

I combine **motion tracking, voice activity analysis** (for turn-taking dynamics), and **ECG** to understand how these factors influence conversation flow and coordination.

## In the wild, 

I investigate how shared **heart rate** and **movement** patterns emerge during group activities like **city exploration trips** and **song festivals**, and how these synchrony patterns contribute to **shared attention** and **social bonding**. 

Using data obtained from **wearable heart rate monitors**, I analyze how physiological signals align between participants in natural social contexts. 

# Whom Do I Work With?

I currently work with my supervisors – [Ivana Konvalinka](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/ivana-konvalinka), [Axel Ahrens](https://www.axelahrens.dk/about-me) and [Line H. Clemmensen](https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/da/persons/line-katrine-harder-clemmensen-2). 

I am open for new collaborations and exciting projects! Drop me a line if you have an idea we can work on together!
