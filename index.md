### Who Am I?

A PhD student at the Social Interaction and Neuroscience Lab (SINeLab) at Technical University of Denmark.

I study how people coordinate their behavior and synchronise physiological signals during social interactions — both in controlled lab experiments and real-world settings.

### My Research

**In the lab**, I examine interpersonal coordination dynamics in conversation:
- how asymmetric noise impacts communication patterns
- how leader-follower dynamics unfold
- how people adjust movements to each other
- what strategies they use to maintain effective dialogue.

I combine motion tracking, voice activity analysis, and ECG to understand how these factors influence conversation flow.

**In the wild**, I investigate how shared heart rate and movement patterns emerge during group activities like city exploration trips and song festivals. Using wearable monitors, I study how physiological signals align in natural social contexts.
