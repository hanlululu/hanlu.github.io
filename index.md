  ### Who Am I?

  A PhD student at the Social Interaction and Neuroscience Lab (SINeLab) at Technical University of Denmark.

  I study how people coordinate their behavior and synchronise physiological signals during social interactions â€” both in controlled lab experiments and real-world settings.

  ### My Research

  **In the lab**, I examine interpersonal coordination dynamics in conversation:

  - how asymmetric noise (where one person experiences reduced hearing abilities while the other does not) impacts communication patterns  
  - how leader-follower dynamics unfold  
  - how people adjust movements to each other  
  - what strategies they use to maintain effective dialogue  

  I combine motion tracking, voice activity analysis (for turn-taking dynamics), and ECG to understand how these factors influence conversation flow and coordination.

  **In the wild**, I investigate how shared heart rate and movement patterns emerge during group activities like city exploration trips and song festivals, and how these synchrony patterns contribute to shared attention and social bonding.

  Using data from wearable heart rate monitors, I analyze how physiological signals align between participants in natural social contexts.
